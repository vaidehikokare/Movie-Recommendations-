 Movie Recommendation System
 Objective
The goal is to build a system that, given a movie title, returns the five most similar movies based on certain features like genres, plot summaries, cast, or user ratings.

Methodology
There are multiple approaches to achieving this:

Content-Based Filtering (Using Movie Features)

Uses the movie's metadata (e.g., genres, directors, actors, descriptions) to find similar movies.
Measures similarity using Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF (Text-based similarity on descriptions), or Jaccard Similarity (for genres).
Example: If you like "Inception," the system may recommend movies with similar themes like "Interstellar" or "Shutter Island."
Collaborative Filtering (Based on User Preferences)

Uses user ratings and behavior to recommend movies.
Techniques:
User-User Similarity: Suggests movies based on users with similar preferences.
Item-Item Similarity: Suggests movies based on how users have rated similar movies.
Example: If many users who watched "Inception" also liked "The Matrix," it will recommend "The Matrix."
Hybrid Approach

Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering for better recommendations.
